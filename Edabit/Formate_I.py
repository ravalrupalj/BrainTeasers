#Format I: Template String
#For each challenge of this series you do not need to submit a function. Instead, you need to submit a template string that can formatted in order to get a certain outcome.
#Write a template string according to the following example:
#Example
a = "John"
b = "Joe"
c = "Jack"
template = "Their names were: {0}, {1} and {2}."
template.format(a, b, c)
#➞ "Their names were: John, Joe and Jack."
#Tips
#A template string is a string that uses curly braces {} as a placeholder that can then be formatted:

"hello, my name is {}".format("John")
#➞ "hello, my name is John."
#Notes
#Sumbit a string, not a function.
#Do not change the name of the variable template.
