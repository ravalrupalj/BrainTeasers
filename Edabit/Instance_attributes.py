#Fullname and Email
#Create the instance attributes fullname and email in the Employee class. Given a person's first and last names:
#Form the fullname by simply joining the first and last name together, separated by a space.
#Form the email by joining the first and last name together with a "." in between, and follow it with '@company.com' at the end. Make sure everything is in lowercase.
#The attributes firstname and lastname are already made for you.
