#Format IV: Escaping Curly Braces
#For each challenge of this series you do not need to submit a function. Instead, you need to submit a template string that can formatted in order to get a certain outcome.
#Write a template string according to the following example. Notice that the template will be formatted twice:
#Example
a = "John"
b = "Joe"
template = "My best friend is ."

template.format(1).format(a, b)
#➞ "My best friend is {{{}}}."
#Tips
#Curly braces can be escaped by doubling them. In a format string, {{ and }} are literal { and } respectively.
#For example:

"{} these, not these {{}}".format("Substitute")
#➞ "Substitute these, not these {}"
#Notes
#Sumbit a string, not a function.
#Do not change the name of the variable template.
