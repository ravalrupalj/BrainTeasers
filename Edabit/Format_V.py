#Format V: Alignment
#For each challenge of this series you do not need to submit a function. Instead, you need to submit a template string that can be formatted in order to get a certain outcome.
#Write three template strings according to the following example. All final strings must have a length of 30 characters. Notice the period . at the end of the strings:
#Example
name = "John"
left_align = "My name is {:<18}."
center_align = "My name is {:^18}."
right_align = "My name is {:>18}."

left_align.format(name)
#➞ "My name is John              ."
center_align.format(name)
#➞ "My name is        John       ."
right_align.format(name)
#➞ "My name is               John."
#Tips
#The placeholders {:<x}, {:^x}, {:>x} are used to align left, center and right respectively within a width x.

#For example:

#"Credits: {:>7}".format(128) ➞ "Credits:     128"
#Notes
#Sumbit a string, not a function.
#Do not change the name of the variables left_align, center_align, right_align.
