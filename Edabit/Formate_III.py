#Format III: Keyword Arguments
#For each challenge of this series you do not need to submit a function. Instead, you need to submit a template string that can formatted in order to get a certain outcome.
#Write a template string according to the following example:
#Example
template = "My {0} is {me}. His {0} is {him}."
template.format("name", me = "John", him = "Joe")
#➞ "My name is John. His name is Joe."
#Tips
#You can pass keyword arguments to .format() that can then be accessed by placing the key inside a place holder.

#For example:

"I'm {age} years old.".format(age = 30)
#➞ "I'm 30 years old."
#Notes
#Submit a string, not a function.
#Do not change the name of the variable template.
