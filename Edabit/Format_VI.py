#Format VI: Padding
#For each challenge of this series you do not need to submit a function. Instead, you need to submit a template string that can formatted in order to get a certain outcome.
#Write a three templates string according to the following example. All final strings must have a length of 20 characters:
#Example
starry = "{:*^20s}"
dash = "{:->20}"
money = "{:$<20}"

starry.format("Starry")
#➞ "*******Starry*******"
dash.format("Dash")
#➞ "----------------Dash"
money.format("Money")
#➞ "Money$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$"
#Tips
#You can pad a string with a placeholder in the format {:cdx} where c is the padding character, d is one of three directions (<, ^ or >) and x is the width.

#For example:

#"Best score{:->15}".format('AAA')
#➞ "Best score------------AAA"
#Notes
#Sumbit a string, not a function.
#Do not change the name of the variables starry, dash and money.
